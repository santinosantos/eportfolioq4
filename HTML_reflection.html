<br>
<div class="div1">
	<p class="bodytext"> This Fourth Quarter in ICT really taught me how to utilize JavaScript in ways to provide better construction for my websites. Aside from coding, I learned a lot with regards to myself - I learned to express myself in creating and layouting websites, and I also realized the importance of community, especially in working with big and daunting scripting languages like CSS, HTML and JavaScript. Even though I was excused in some classes of ICT, I was able to catch up with my lessons and ultimately gain great knowledge from it. In a digitizing world, we need to improve our skillsets to match the ever-growing demand for web-competent workers. I am indeed blessed that even though I am taught the basics of JavaScript, I can use it eventually to improve and develop myself in the situation that I pursue a course in web development. As this quarter is the culmination of the school year, I am beyond happy that I get to conclude it with knowledge inside my brain. Thank you to Ms. Uminga and my class and schoolmates for making this a wonderful year. The song "Brindisi" I linked above from the opera "La Traviata" shows the cheerfulness and gaudiness of this quarter.</b> </p>
